# Bsc-Project

My BSc Project is completing about the theoretical Aspects of Deep Learning. Specifically, Variational Inference, Variational AutoEncoders, and how they can solve a Representation Learning Problem as a tool.
We are using the argued theories for Estimating the distribution of possible events, generating new samples based on perceived distribution, Like giving the same speech with different tunes or developing the same face with other facial expressions.
